# control_system
#we will explain how to solve a system of non-linear equations to find the equilibrium points and then check the stability of the system at the given equilibrium points using Octave
#In this task we will be implementing the frequency filters through coding in Octave. 
#In this task, we will be implementing Pole Placement Controller and the LQR controller on different types of physical systems
